# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-14

### Changed
- **Major Migration:** Migrated from a Vite+React+MDX app-template to a fully Astro-powered template for documentation and static site generation.
- **Simplified Structure:** Removed Vite, React Router, and complex MDX import logic in favor of Astro content collections and dynamic routes.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** Dramatically reduced project complexity, improved maintainability, and made interactive code and theming easier to implement.
- **Modernized Workflow:** All navigation, theming, and code embedding now handled by Astro and simple CSS/JS. Interactive code examples use React components loaded with Astro's client directives.
- **Updated Documentation:** Updated `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to reflect the new Astro-based structure.

# Changelog

## [1.7.4] - 2025-07-24

### Changed
- **App Template Version**: Bumped app-template version to 1.7.4
- **Setup Script Cleanup**: Both setup scripts (`setup.sh` and `setup.bat`) now proactively delete `app/src/docs` (or `%TARGET_DIR%\src\docs`) before copying the app template, ensuring a clean state and preventing stale symlinks, files, or directories from interfering with updates.

### Fixed
- **Pre-copy Directory Removal**: Prevents copy errors and ensures template updates work reliably even if `src/docs` exists as a symlink, file, or directory from previous runs.

## [1.7.3] - 2025-07-24

### Changed
- **App Template Version**: Bumped app-template version to 1.7.3
- **Setup Script Robustness**: Improved cross-platform setup scripts (`setup.sh` and `setup.bat`) to robustly remove `src/docs` whether it is a symlink, file, or directory before copying the template. Ensures reliable updates and prevents copy errors on both Unix and Windows environments.

### Fixed
- **Symlink/Directory Handling**: Resolved edge cases where `src/docs` could block template updates due to being a symlink, file, or directory. Now always cleaned up correctly before copying.

### Changed
- **App Template Version**: Bumped app-template version to 1.7.1
- **Static Asset Fetching**: CodePlayground now fetches all snippet files from the public directory using root-relative URLs, ensuring compatibility with GitHub Pages and other static hosts.

## [1.7.2] - 2025-07-24

### Changed
- **App Template Version**: Bumped app-template version to 1.7.2
- **Base Path Support**: CodePlayground now prepends the configured base path (`import.meta.env.BASE_URL`) to all static asset fetches, ensuring compatibility with custom deployments and GitHub Pages.

### Fixed
- **Asset Fetching on Custom Base Paths**: Resolved issues with file loading when the app is deployed under a non-root base path.

### Fixed
- **404 Errors on GitHub Pages**: Resolved file loading issues by switching to public directory for all fetchable assets.

## [1.7.1] - 2025-07-24

### Changed
- **App Template Version**: Bumped app-template version to 1.7.1
- **Static Asset Fetching**: CodePlayground now fetches all snippet files from the public directory using root-relative URLs, ensuring compatibility with GitHub Pages and other static hosts.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-07-24

### Added
- **Raw File Support in CodePlayground**: You can now pass any file type (e.g., .txt, .md, .json) to CodePlayground. Non-code files are displayed in a styled <pre> block, while code files use Sandpack as before.
- **Automatic File Type Detection**: CodePlayground automatically detects unsupported file types and renders them as raw text.

### Improved
- **Seamless Integration**: Sandpack integration for code files is robust; raw files display cleanly and consistently.

### Changed
- **App Template Version**: Bumped app-template version to 1.7.0

## [1.6.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added
- Improved generated file organization: all MDX validation/filtering outputs now in `src/generated/`.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added
